##This project is a Java-based application designed to demonstrate how a program can interact with a public web service to retrieve and display real-time weather information. It functions as a simple REST API client that connects to a free weather data provider and fetches details such as temperature, windspeed, and time for a specific location—in this case, Tokyo, Japan. The purpose of this project is to show how Java can be used to perform tasks that involve sending internet requests, receiving data from external sources, and processing that data in a useful way. The program begins by constructing a web request to the weather service using Java’s built-in networking features. It then receives a response in text format, from which it identifies and extracts the necessary weather information using basic string manipulation techniques. This approach avoids the need for complex data processing and keeps the project lightweight and easy to understand. After the required information is extracted, the application displays it in a clear and structured format in the console, making it easy for the user to read and interpret the weather conditions. One of the core strengths of the project is its simplicity and modular structure, which separates the logic for making web requests, handling responses, extracting information, and displaying output. This design not only improves readability but also makes it easier to expand or modify the program in the future. For example, developers could update the program to support user input for different locations, add additional weather data points, or even incorporate a graphical interface for better user experience. Because the project uses only standard Java features, it does not require any external libraries or tools, which makes it easy to set up and run on any system that has Java installed. This makes it especially suitable for students or beginners who want to learn the fundamentals of client-server communication and web integration using Java. Additionally, the project introduces important software development practices such as handling potential errors gracefully through exception management, writing clean and reusable code, and thinking logically when working with textual data. It provides practical experience in connecting real-world services with Java code and illustrates how useful and relevant programming becomes when applied to real-time data sources. From a learning perspective, the project encourages hands-on experimentation, as users can easily modify parts of the code to fetch data from different locations, change how the output is displayed, or even integrate more advanced features. In summary, this project serves as a foundational example of how Java can be used to build network-aware applications that consume public data services. It is simple enough for beginners to follow, yet meaningful enough to demonstrate key programming concepts that are widely used in modern software development. By completing this project, learners gain valuable experience in writing code that communicates over the internet, processes live data, and produces structured output—skills that are essential for building interactive, data-driven applications in the real world.
